# Introducing - RPCraft: Apocalypse Then
A Minecraft 1.8 Modpack for RPCraft. Originally created as an experimental back has turned into a multiplayer survival server. At this stage the files that are used for the server to create the world experience have not been included. Mainly because the world creation process is not easy to document. This may be remided on future versions.

Modlist:
Will soon be made publically available.
